Summary: The Principal Software Engineer II will be a member of a team of software engineers dedicated to accelerating science at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus. This position requires a passion for coding, expert-level proficiency in multiple languages such as Java, C++, or Python, strong technical leadership skills, and a track record of extraordinary technical accomplishments.
Essential Duties and Responsibilities:
Software Development
Will write excellent code, which means customizing implementation decisions based on (a) understanding the software development lifecycle, spanning customer requirements, planning, design, prototyping, agile feedback, implementation, maintenance, testing, requirements staging, (b) technology selection, (c) implementation style (degree of object orientation, degree of performance optimization, framework leverage), (d) likelihood of reusability or service containerization, (e) documentation requirements.
Software Pattern and Architecture Awareness
Will approach projects not merely with a code-writing mentality, but with a holistic awareness of software design patterns and systems architecture appropriate for the task. These, in turn, will influence code-writing style and technology choices.
Technical Leadership
Will be capable of translating technical requirements into an agile strategy that emphasizes user engagement and encompasses software design, development, implementation, and testing for a small group of software engineers. The candidate will be the person for expert-level questions about software development.
Extraordinary Technical Excellence
Will be capable of authoring software at an expert level, competitive in quality, in all respects, with the very best developers at any organization.
Customer Service
Will be responsive to Janelia scientists, labs, and projects. This means attending meetings, brainstorm sessions, building working relationships with scientists, post-docs, and other software developers and project stakeholders. Active solicitation of feedback and prioritization is important, as is timely delivery of working software components.
Skills Development
The candidate will take responsibility for continuously improving and building their software skillset, to increase their impact and project versatility. Additionally, new projects will often
require becoming familiar with specific tools, frameworks, and techniques. Learning is expected to be a core job responsibility.
Communication
Will effectively communicate with both scientist customers and team members, including ad-hoc conversations, meetings, presentations, emails, and group collaboration tools as-needed.
Collaboration
Will frequently and effectively collaborate with other team members on technology decisions, coding style, workflow prioritization, and general project management. This will require the free give and take of ideas, and sometimes require compromising individual preferences.
In addition to the duties specifically identified by this job description, the position will include other duties if and as assigned by the direct supervisor or others with supervisory authority over this position.
Scope:
This is an individual contributor role and has no supervisory or budget responsibilities.
