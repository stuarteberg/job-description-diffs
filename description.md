Summary:
The Software Engineer will be a member of a team of software engineers dedicated to accelerating science at the HHMI Janelia Research Campus. This position requires a passion for coding, with demonstrated proficiency in a scripting language such as Python, and preferably experience with a general language such as Java or C++.
Essential Duties and Responsibilities:
Software Development
Will write good code, which means learning to make implementation decisions based on (a) understanding the software development lifecycle, spanning customer requirements, planning, design, prototyping, agile feedback, implementation, maintenance, testing, requirements staging, (b) technology selection, (c) implementation style (degree of object orientation, degree of performance optimization, framework leverage), (d) likelihood of reusability or service containerization, (e) documentation requirements.
Customer Service
Will be responsive to Janelia scientists, labs, and projects. This means attending meetings, brainstorm sessions, building working relationships with scientists, post-docs, and other software developers and project stakeholders. Active solicitation of feedback and prioritization is important, as is timely delivery of working software components.
Skills Development
Will take responsibility for continuously improving and building their software skillset, to increase their impact and project versatility. Additionally, new projects will often require becoming familiar with specific tools, frameworks, and techniques. Learning is expected to be a core job responsibility.
Communication
Will effectively communicate with both scientist customers and team members, including ad-hoc conversations, meetings, presentations, emails, and group collaboration tools as-needed.
Collaboration
Will frequently and effectively collaborate with other team members on technology decisions, coding style, and workflow prioritization. This will require the free give and take of ideas, and sometimes require compromising individual preferences.
In addition to the duties specifically identified by this job description, the position will include other duties if and as assigned by the direct supervisor or others with supervisory authority over this position.
